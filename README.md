### Calculator (2025)

This JavaScript-based calculator is a sleek, interactive tool designed with essential mathematical functions. It features clickable buttons for π (pi), allowing users to insert the mathematical constant directly into calculations; a percent (%) button to quickly compute percentages, a square (x²) button for squaring numbers, a square root (√) button for extracting roots, and a plus-minus (±) toggle to switch between positive and negative values. Built with HTML for structure, the calculator updates its display in real time as users input values and operations, offering a smooth and intuitive user experience ideal for both casual and academic use.
